Some configuration required. See separate readme in ./contract and ./ui

The C++ contract is in the contract folder.

The React UI is in the ui folder.

A third element is required.  A token account to manage tokens for this contract. (more in ./contract/readme.txt)


*** The only wallet integration is with Anchor using UAL therefore to interact with the contract using with the react UI Anchor is required to be configured with an account that has been issued TTT tokens.
